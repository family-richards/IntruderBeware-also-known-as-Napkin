  **This is WIP** This is not finished at all, mainly just an idea.
  Iris by Lowes was a great security system, but it came and went. I decided to make my own security system in response.  It's inspired by Flare, a really cool security system, but sadly their website came down and you can't buy them anymore. Let me know if they came back. You can check the wesite here: www.buddyguard.io  
  It has a motion detector, a camera, and a ESP32. The plan is to add everything you need to set up your own IntruderBeware.
