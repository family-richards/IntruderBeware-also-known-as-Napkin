# IntrudersBeware-also-known-as-NapkinFire

  Iris by Lowes was a great security system, but it came and went. I decided to make my own security system in response. Originally called NapkinFire, I renamed it to IntruderBeware. It's inspired by Flare, a really cool security system, but sadly their website came down and you can't buy them anymore. Let me know if they came back. You can check the wesite here: www.buddyguard.io  
  It has a motion detector, a camera, and a ESP32. The plan is to add everything you need to set up your own IntruderBeware.

  THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
