# IntrudersBeware-also-known-as-NapkinFire

Iris by Lowes was a great security system, but it came and went. I decided to make my own security system in response. Originally called NapkinFire, I renamed it to IntrudersBeware. It's based on Flare, a really cool security system, but sadly their website came down and you can't buy them anymore. Let me know if they came back. You can check the wesite here: www.buddyguard.io
It has a motion detector, a camera, and a ESP32. The plan is to add the fritzing files, gerber zips, and the TinkerCAD website to this repository.  
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
