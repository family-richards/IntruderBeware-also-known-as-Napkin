Thanks for choosing IntruderBeware! The first thing you'll need to do is download this repository. Download the zip of it, and then unzip it.  
Now, get a ESP32 Feather. You can get one here: https://adafru.it/3405  
Find the folder called "code". Open it, and find the folder called "setupwizard". Open it, too.  
Now, make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed. If not, download it here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software  
If you need to, restart your computer. When you're back in /code/setupwizard, open the file called setupwizard.ino (or on Windows it might be called just setupwizard). The Arduino IDE should open.  
Take your ESP32 Feather, and find a matching USB cable. If you've already plugged it in, unplug it.  
Before we get started, we need to test your ESP32. In the Arduino IDE, click on File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink  
Now, click on Tools > Port. Write down all of the numbers and letters. Click away from Tools > Port now.  
Next, plug in your ESP32 Feather. Click on Tools > Port again. Find the combination of numbers and letters that isn't on the list, and click on it.  
After that, click on File > Preferences. Find the place where it says "Additional Boards Manager URLs:". Click on the icon that looks like this: ![](popout.png)
