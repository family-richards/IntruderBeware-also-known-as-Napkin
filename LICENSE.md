THESE ARE THE RULES:
If you do stuff with the software/hardware, let us know!
Any stuff you do with it, we can tell you to stop.
No liability, no warranty.
Got it? Good. We'll all get along better if we follow these rules.
Oh, and if you run in to us, depending on our age, buy us a beer/juice/mac+cheese.
:)
